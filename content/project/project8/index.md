## 1. Introduction
{style="color: #BBDEFC"}

The client for this project is a sports company specializing in extreme activities, including modalities like skiing, hiking, climbing, and scuba diving, among others. However, the company's database has not been properly analyzed, leaving many potential insights unexplored. The company seeks to uncover valuable information, particularly related to sales, clients, products, and distribution channels. To achieve this, a plan involving six sprint weeks, managed by the directors of various departments, has been proposed to extract and analyze this critical data.

Notes:

## 2. Objectives
{style="color: #BBDEFC"}

The main objective of this project is to thoroughly analyze the company's database to extract insights and valuable information related to sales, clients, products, and distribution channels. The project is designed to simulate real-world operations, with 6 sprint weeks planned and regular interactions with various departments. The insights gained from this analysis are expected to significantly enhance the company's performance, leading to increased profitability and reduced costs.

This entire project is conducted using **MySQL**, an open-source relational database management system. Specifically, the **MySQL Workbench** IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used for the database analysis.

## 3. Project Results
{style="color: #BBDEFC"}

As mentioned earlier, the project is divided into several sprint weeks, each with specific goals and interactions with various departments of the company. These sprints are designed to address different aspects of the business, such as sales, clients, products, and distribution channels.

The different department directors and their main goals are presented in the image below.

### 3.1 Sprint Week 1
{style="color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal"}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 1. Database Access</text>

In the first sprint week, we have recieved the following email from the IT Director.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw1_task1.png" title="Sprint Week 1. Task 1." >}}

Following the IT Director's advice, we need to import the database provided by the IT team, activate it in the MySQL Workbench environment, and review the content of the main tables. This can be done with the following code:

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 1 - TASK 1
---------------------------------------------

-- Import database from dump: database.sql

-- Activate the database as the default one
use project_database;

-- Review the dataset content in the main four tables
select * from channels;
select * from products;
select * from stores;
select * from sales;
```

Now we need to check the granularity of the database and identify if any duplicate records exist. To do this, we can use the following SQL query:

```mysql
-- Â¿Is it the granularity of the dataset right?
select count(*) as COUNT from sales
group by id_store, id_prod, id_channel, date_time
having COUNT > 1;

-- It seems that some of the records are duplicated, let's investigate that
select id_store, id_prod, id_channel, date_time, count(*) as COUNT from sales
group by id_store, id_prod, id_channel, date_time
having COUNT > 1
order by id_store, id_prod, id_channel, date_time;

-- Some particular cases
select * from sales
where id_store = 1115
  and id_prod = 127110
  and id_channel = 5
  and date_time = '22/12/2016';
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw1_r1.png" title="Sprint Week 1. Results 1." >}}

It seems the dataset's granularity is incorrect, and some records are duplicated. This could be due to missing fields, such as the time when orders were taken or the number of orders on the same date. To analyze the data properly, we need to fix these issues.

A simple but effective approach is to combine the duplicated records by summing the total amount and considering the average value for the official and offer prices. In addition, a new field for turnover is created, calculated by multiplying the total amount by the average offer price for each record. Here, you can see an example of how to do that:

```mysql
-- We need to create a new table sales_agr with the right granularity, and also:
  -- Change the date_time type 
  -- Create a new field called turnover as the multiplication of amount times offer_price
create table sales_agr as
select str_to_date(date_time, '%d/%m/%Y') as date_time,
  id_prod, id_store, id_channel,
  sum(amount) as amount,
  avg(official_price) as official_price,
  avg(offer_price) as offer_price,
  round(sum(amount) * avg(offer_price),2) as turnover
from sales
group by 1, 2, 3, 4;
```

Now that we have created a new table with the correct granularity and adjusted the *date_time* type, we can move forward with the analysis. The cleaned table will allow for more accurate insights and ensure that the dataset is ready for deeper exploration, such as analyzing sales trends, client behavior, and product performance.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw1_r2.png" title="Sprint Week 1. Results 2." >}}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 2. Entity-Relationship Diagram</text>

After completing the first task we recieved a new email from the IT Director.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw1_task2.png" title="Sprint Week 1. Task 2." >}}

It seems that the new created table *sales_agr* is still not properly connected with the rest of the tables. We need to fix that:

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 1 - TASK 2
---------------------------------------------
-- The new sales_agr table is not connected with the rest of the tables. We need
 --  to include a new key field called id_sale
 --  id_prod as a FK with the corresponding table
 --  id_store as a FK with the corresponding table
 --  id_channel as a FK with the corresponding table
alter table sales_agr add id_sale int auto_increment primary key,
                      add foreign key(id_prod) references products (id_prod) on delete cascade,
                      add foreign key(id_store) references stores (id_store) on delete cascade,
                      add foreign key(id_channel) references channels (id_channel) on delete cascade;
```

The resultant Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram can be seen in the image below.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw1_r3.png" title="Sprint Week 1. Results 3." >}}

We can now proceed with order identification as suggested by the IT Director. To do this, we will define an order as all the products purchased by the same store, through the same channel, on the same date. It can be accomplish with the following code:

```mysql
-- Create a view over sales_agr that includes the order id
create view v_sales_agr_order as 
with master_orders as (
  select date_time, id_store, id_channel, row_number() over() as id_order
  from sales_agr
  group by date_time, id_store, id_channel)

select id_sale, id_order, s.date_time, s.id_prod, s.id_store, s.id_channel, amount, official_price, offer_price, turnover 
from sales_agr as s
  left join master_orders as m
  on (s.date_time = m.date_time) and (s.id_store = m.id_store) and (s.id_channel = m.id_channel);
    
select * from v_sales_agr_order;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw1_r4.png" title="Sprint Week 1. Results 4." >}}


### 3.2 Sprint Week 2
{style="color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal"}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 1. Starting point</text>

At the beginning of the second sprint week we received an email from the Strategy Director with some general questions.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw2_task1.png" title="Sprint Week 2. Task 1." >}}

These general questions about the order, dates, products, stores, and channels can be easily solved with the following querys:

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 2 - TASK 1
---------------------------------------------

-- How many orders do we have in the historical data?
select max(id_order) from v_sales_agr_order;

-- From which day do we have data?
select min(date_time) as first_day, max(date_time) as last_day from sales_agr;

-- How many different products do we have in our catalog?
select count(distinct id_prod) as num_prod from products;

-- How many different stores do we distribute to?
select count(distinct id_store) as num_store from stores;

-- Through which channels can orders be placed with us?
select distinct channel from channels;
```

Through these queries, we have discovered some new insights. There are 22721 orders in the company's historical data. Our records span from 2015-01-12 to 2018-07-20. We have 274 different products in our catalog and work with 562 different stores to distribute our products. The available channels for placing orders include: Fax, Telephone, Mail, E-mail, Web, Sales visits, Special, and Other.

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 2. Channels and clients analysis</text>

We've received a new email from the Marketing Director requesting more detailed information about the channel dimension. Additionally, data on client performance is also required at this stage.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw2_task2.png" title="Sprint Week 2. Task 2." >}}

These questions can be solved with the following querys:

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 2 - TASK 2
---------------------------------------------

-- What are the top 3 channels with the highest turnover?
select channel, round(sum(turnover),2) as turnover_channel
from sales_agr as s
  left join channels as c
  on s.id_channel = c.id_channel
group  by s.id_channel
order by turnover_channel desc
limit 3;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw2_r1.png" title="Sprint Week 2. Results 1." >}}


```mysql
-- What is the monthly turnover trend per channel over the last 12 full months?
select channel, month(date_time) as month, round(sum(turnover),2) as turnover_channel
from sales_agr as s
  left join channels as c
  on s.id_channel = c.id_channel
where date_time between '2017-07-01' and '2018-06-30'
group by s.id_channel, month
order by s.id_channel, month;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw2_r2.png" title="Sprint Week 2. Results 2." >}}

```mysql
-- What are the top 50 clients (stores with highest turnover)?
select store_name, round(sum(turnover),2) as turnover_store
from sales_agr as s
  left join stores as st
  on s.id_store = st.id_store
group by s.id_store
order by turnover_store desc
limit 50;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw2_r3.png" title="Sprint Week 2. Results 3." >}}

```mysql
-- Turnover trend by country per term since 2017.	
select country, year(date_time) as year, quarter(date_time) as quarter, round(sum(turnover),2) as turnover_quarter
from sales_agr as s
  left join stores as st
  on s.id_store = st.id_store
where date_time between '2017-01-01' and '2018-06-30'
group by country, year, quarter
order by country, year, quarter;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw2_r4.png" title="Sprint Week 2. Results 4." >}}


### 3.3 Sprint Week 3
{style="color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal"}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 1. Margin analysis</text>

In the thrid sprint week, we have received the next email from the Financial Director.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_task1.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Task 1." >}}

To identify the products with the highest margins for each product line, we first need to define what we mean by margin. For this project, it will be considered as the net profit in percantage, which is:

{{< math >}}
$$
\textup{Margin}[\%] = \frac{\textup{Price} - \textup{Cost}}{\textup{Cost}} \cdot 100.
$$
{{< /math >}}

In addition, to separate the margin for each product line, we need to use what are called **window functions**. Specifically, we need to create a ranking partitioned by the product line. Additionally, a **common table expression** (CTE) and a **subquery** are required to properly access the ranking and the margin variables created. This can be achieved with the following code:

```mysql
-- Find the top 20 products with higer margins for each line
with table_margin as(
  select *, round((price-cost)/cost*100, 2) as margin
  from products)

select *
from (select id_prod, line, product, margin, row_number() over(partition by line order by margin desc) as ranking
      from table_margin) as subquery_ranking
where ranking <= 20;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_r1.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Results 1." >}}

On the other hand, to identify products with excessive discounts, we will consider that a product's discount should not exceed the value that falls below the 90% of all discounts. This means that in the discount distribution, the maximum allowable discount corresponds to the value at the 90th percentile of that distribution. Discounts are defined as follows:

{{< math >}}
$$
\textup{Discount}[\%] = \frac{\textup{Price}_{\textup{official}} - \textup{Price}_{\textup{offer}}}{\textup{Price}_{\textup{official}}} \cdot 100,
$$
{{< /math >}}

where the official and offer prices first need to be averaged for each product line. We can solve this query with the following code:

```mysql
-- Find those products (id_prod) with discounts that exceed the value that falls below the 90% of all discounts
with table_discount as(
  select *, (official_price_avg - offer_price_avg) / official_price_avg as discount
  from(select id_prod, avg(official_price) as official_price_avg, avg(offer_price) as offer_price_avg
       from sales_agr
       group by id_prod) as subquery_avg_price)

select *
from (select id_prod, round(discount*100, 2) as discount, round(cume_dist() over(order by discount), 5) as discount_dist
      from table_discount) as subquery_dist
where discount_dist >= 0.9;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_r2.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Results 2." >}}


<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 2. Cost reduction analysis</text>

Weâve received a new email from the Financial Director requesting more information about the company's product portfolio and how many products can be eliminated while still maintaining at least 90% of the company's turnover.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_task2.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Task 2." >}}


The approach for solving product selection is as follows: first, we need to order the products by turnover. Once this is done, we calculate the total turnover, allowing us to determine the cumulative percentage each product contributes to the total revenue. Finally, we select the products that account for up to 90% of the total turnover.

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 3 - TASK 2
---------------------------------------------

-- How many products are we selling?
select count(distinct product) from products; #144 different products
select count(distinct id_prod) from products; #274 different products (color distinction)

-- Which products would we need to keep to maintain 90% of the current turnover?
with table_turnover_prod_cum_per as(
  select id_prod,
         round(sum(turnover_prod) over(order by turnover_prod desc), 2) as turnover_prod_cum,
         round(sum(turnover_prod) over(), 2) as turnover_prod_total,
         round(sum(turnover_prod) over(order by turnover_prod desc)/sum(turnover_prod) over(), 4) as turnover_prod_cum_per
  from (select id_prod, sum(turnover) as turnover_prod
        from sales_agr
        group by id_prod
        order by turnover_prod desc) as subquery_turnover_prod)

select id_prod, turnover_prod_cum, turnover_prod_cum_per
from table_turnover_prod_cum_per
where turnover_prod_cum_per <= 0.9;

-- And therefore, which specific products could we eliminate and still maintain 90% of the revenue?
with table_turnover_prod_cum_per as(
  select id_prod,
         round(sum(turnover_prod) over(order by turnover_prod desc), 2) as turnover_prod_cum,
         round(sum(turnover_prod) over(), 2) as turnover_prod_total,
         round(sum(turnover_prod) over(order by turnover_prod desc)/sum(turnover_prod) over(), 4) as turnover_prod_cum_per
  from (select id_prod, sum(turnover) as turnover_prod
        from sales_agr
        group by id_prod
        order by turnover_prod desc) as subquery_turnover_prod)

select id_prod, turnover_prod_cum, turnover_prod_cum_per
from table_turnover_prod_cum_per
where turnover_prod_cum_per > 0.9;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_r3.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Results 3." >}}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 3. Product lines analysis</text>

At the end of the third sprint week, we received another email from the Marketing Director.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_task3.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Task 3." >}}

She is concerned about the various product lines and how we can reduce costs in that area without significantly impacting the companyâs overall turnover. We can investigate that with the code below:

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 3 - TASK 3
---------------------------------------------

-- What different product lines are we selling?
select distinct line from products;

-- What is the contribution (in percentage) of each line to the total turnover?
with table_turnover_line as(
  select line, round(sum(turnover), 2) as turnover_line
  from sales_agr as s
    left join products as p
    on s.id_prod = p.id_prod
  group by line
  order by turnover_line desc)

select line, turnover_line, round(turnover_line / sum(turnover_line) over(), 2) as turnover_line_per
from table_turnover_line;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_r4.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Results 4." >}}

The best-seller product line is *Personal Accessories* holding a 33% of the overall turnover. On the other hand, *Outdoor Protection* line accounts for only 1% of the overall turnover, so eliminating this product line should be considered.

Additionally, we need to identify which products are on trend. In this context, we will define a trend as the productâs performance over the last two terms, comparing the evolution between the first and second terms of 2018. We can obtain this information with the following query:

```mysql
-- Inside the top-seller product line, is there any particular product on trend?
with table_prod_quarter as(
  select line, product, quarter(date_time) as quarter, round(sum(turnover),2) as turnover_prod
  from sales_agr as s
    left join products as p
    on s.id_prod = p.id_prod
  where line = 'Personal Accessories' and date_time between '2018-01-01' and '2018-06-30'
  group by product, quarter
  order by product, quarter)

select product, trend
from (select line, product, quarter, turnover_prod,
             round(turnover_prod / lag(turnover_prod) over(partition by product order by quarter), 4) as trend
      from table_prod_quarter) as subquery_trend
where trend is not null
order by trend desc;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw3_r5.png" title="Sprint Week 3. Results 5." >}}

Note that to compare trends between the two quarters, we need to use the **lag** function. This allows us to divide the total turnover of the second quarter by that of the first. Additionally, a **partition by** product is required to differentiate the products in the segmentation. Finally, only the product and trend information are included in the results.


### 3.4 Sprint Week 4
{style="color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal"}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 1. Client analysis and segmentation</text>

In the fourth sprint week, we have received the next email from the Sales Director.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw4_task1.png" title="Sprint Week 4. Task 1." >}}

We are now focusing more deeply on the client sector. In this context, we aim to create a client segmentation, evaluate customer growth potential, and reactivate clients who haven't made purchases in the last three months.

For client segmentation, more powerful tools like machine learning approaches exist, but it is still possible to achieve meaningful results using SQL. In this case, we will create a 4-segment matrix based on the number of orders and the client's turnover. This matrix will be divided by two axes, separating records above and below the average. It can be done with the following code:

```mysql
# SPRINT WEEK 4 - TASK 1
---------------------------------------------

-- Client segmentation: 
  -- Create a 4-segment matrix based on the number of orders and client (store) turnover
  -- Each axis will divide between those above and below the average
  -- Save the query as a view for easy access
create view v_segmentation_matrix as
with table_orders_turnover_store as(
  select id_store, count(distinct id_order) as num_orders, round(sum(turnover), 2) as turnover_store
  from v_sales_agr_order
  group by id_store),

  table_avg as(
    select round(avg(num_orders), 2) as avg_orders, round(avg(turnover_store), 2) as avg_turnover_store
    from table_orders_turnover_store)

select *,
       case
          when num_orders <= avg_orders and turnover_store <= avg_turnover_store then 'O- T-'
          when num_orders <= avg_orders and turnover_store > avg_turnover_store then 'O- T+'
          when num_orders > avg_orders and turnover_store <= avg_turnover_store then 'O+ T-'
          when num_orders > avg_orders and turnover_store > avg_turnover_store then 'O+ T+'
          else 'ERROR'
       end as segmentation
from table_orders_turnover_store, table_avg;

-- Calculate how many customers we have in each segment of the matrix
select segmentation, count(*)
from v_segmentation_matrix
group by segmentation;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw4_r1.png" title="Sprint Week 4. Results 1." >}}

With this framework, we are able to identify the four main types of customers, which are:

* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Customers (stores) with high turnover and a high volume of orders:</text> This group is the most valuable to the company, so the strategy should focus on maintaining these clients.
* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Customers (stores) with high turnover and a low volume of orders:</text> Although they place fewer orders, the orders they do generate significant turnover. The company should develop targeted strategies to increase their order frequency.
* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Customers (stores) with low turnover and a high volume of orders:</text> This group places many orders, but the associated turnover is relatively low. Strategies should focus on increasing the average order value from this group.
* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Customers (stores) with low turnover and a low volume of orders:</text> This is the least beneficial group for the company, as their order frequency and turnover are both low. No specific campaigns are needed for this group.


Working now on the second point, which is the evaluation of the growth potential of each client (store), a common approach is to segment customers by their main activity. The 75th percentile within each segment is typically set as the target. Clients with a significant gap from that value show great potential, and with minor adjustments in the commercial strategy, their turnover can be significantly improved. This information can be gathered with the code developed below:

```mysql
-- Growth potential:
  -- Segment the stores by their type, and calculate the 75th percentile (P75) of the revenue
  -- For each store that is below the 75th percentile (P75), calculate its growth potential
with table_store_type as(
  select s.id_store, type, round(sum(turnover), 0) as turnover_store_type
  from sales_agr as s
    left join stores as st
    on s.id_store = st.id_store
  group by s.id_store, type
  order by type, s.id_store),
    
     table_p75_values as(
  select type, turnover_store_type as turnover_p75
  from (select *, row_number() over(partition by type order by percentil) as ranking
        from (select *, round(percent_rank() over(partition by type order by turnover_store_type)*100, 2)as percentile
              from table_store_type) as subquery_percent
        where percentil >= 75) as subquery_ranking
  where ranking = 1)

select id_store, t1.type, turnover_store_type, turnover_p75,
       case
          when (turnover_store_type - turnover_p75) >= 0 then 0
          when (turnover_store_type - turnover_p75) < 0 then round(turnover_p75 - turnover_store_type, 0)
          else -999999999999
       end as potential
from table_store_type as t1
  inner join table_p75_values as t2
  on t1.type = t2.type
order by potential desc;
```
{{< figure src="/project8/sw4_r2.png" title="Sprint Week 4. Results 2." >}}

For this query, we first need to create two **common table expressions (CTEs)**: one to gather the necessary information from the relevant tables, and a second to calculate the 75th percentile values for each store type. The **percent_rank** and **row_number** functions are used to calculate the percentile progression by type and to identify the first value that surpasses the 75th percentile, respectively. A **CASE WHEN** structure is applied in the final query to distinguish stores with turnover greater than the 75th percentile. Finally, the stores are ordered by growth potential. It appears that Golf Shop stores are significantly below the optimal value, presenting a great opportunity to increase the company's revenue.


Now, focusing on client reactivation, we define inactive clients as stores that have not made a purchase in the last 90 days. This information can be retrieved using the following code:

```mysql
-- Client reactivation:
  -- Identify customers who haven't made a purchase in over 3 months
with table_last_date_total as(
  select max(date_time) as last_date_total
  from sales_agr),
    
     table_last_date_store as(
  select id_store, max(date_time) as last_date_store
  from sales_agr
  group by id_store)
    
select *
from (select *, datediff(last_date_total,last_date_store) as days_no_purchase
      from table_last_date_store, table_last_date_total) as subquery_days
where days_no_purchase > 90
order by days_no_purchase desc;
```

{{< figure src="/project8/sw4_r3.png" title="Sprint Week 4. Results 3." >}}

Note that only 15 stores have not made a purchase in the last 3 months, so targeted campaigns can be implemented to reactivate these specific stores.


### 3.5 Sprint Week 5
{style="color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal"}

<text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Task 1. Recommendation system</text>

In the fifth sprint week, we received the final email from the Marketing Director, requesting a basic recommendation system based on each store's historical purchases. While more powerful tools like Python or R are available for this purpose, itâs still possible to achieve meaningful results using SQL.

{{< figure src="/project8/sw5_task1.png" title="Sprint Week 5. Task 1." >}}
