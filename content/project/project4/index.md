{style="color: #BBDEFC"}

The client for this project is a hotel group specializing in the vacation market. They operate several hotels and rooms worldwide. However, the general performance of the group is not properly organized. Consequently, they need a functional and interactive dashboard displaying the main KPIs and the most relevant information to streamline the operations of the company.

Notes:

* This article presents a technical explanation of the development process followed in the project.

## 3. Project Design

To establish the levers, a brief explanation about the customer journey is requiered. The first step is when a user visits the ecommerce website. Typically, they will come from:

* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Paid campaigns:</text> Paid ads such as Facebook Ads or Google Ads.
* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Organic content:</text> Blog, social media, etc.
* <text style='color: #BBDEFC; font-weight: normal;'>Direct traffic:</text> Knows the URL and enters it directly into the browser.

The second step occurs when the user browses the website and adds a product to the cart.

* They can remove products from the cart, exit without making a purchase, or ultimately place an order.
* A common process is cross-selling, where other products that might interest the user are recommended.

The third step involves customer re-engagement through retargeting or email marketing.
