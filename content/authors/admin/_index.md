My name is Pablo Esteban. I'm passionate about solving problems and optimizing processes, especially those related to coding and business knowledge.

---

Since I was a child, I have always been curious about how the world around me worked. This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Industrial Engineering. During my studies, I gained knowledge in multiple disciplines, but I was particularly captivated by Fluid Mechanics.

After completing my bachelor's and master's degrees, I had the opportunity to work as a researcher in the Fluid Mechanics department at the University of Málaga, which prompted me to start my doctoral studies. Over the course of four years, I worked on the propulsion of small aquatic vehicles and the energy harvesting through bio-inspired devices. Additionally, I completed a research stay in Luleå, Sweden, where I collaborated with the team responsible for designing hydraulic turbines and improved my English proficiency.

These four years of hard work showed me that my true passion lies in the world of Data Science. Consequently, I decided to further my education in this field by completing an intensive six-month training course in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and business analytics using Python, SQL, and Tableau.

My goal now is to build a career in this new field, helping individuals and companies become more efficient and productive through data analysis.
